# google-clone
Making a clone of the google homepage for TOP
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

A basic introduction of how to use HTML and CSS to construct a webpage. 
- used selectors and pseudo-selectors in my CSS to specify which HTML elements to manipulate
- Used padding and margins to align elements
- Used basic forms
- Used various methods to align elements

I also gained a serious appreciation for minimalistic design.
